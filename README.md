<p align="center"><i>If biases are baked into models such as <b>GPT-3</b> and <b>BERT</b>, they may infect applications built on top of them. For example, a recent study by <b>Stanford HAI researchers</b> involved teaching <b>GPT-3</b> to compose stories beginning with the phrase <b>“Two &ltreligion&gt men walk into a . . .”</b>. 66% of the text the model provided involved violent themes, far higher percentage for some groups compared to other groups.</i></p>
